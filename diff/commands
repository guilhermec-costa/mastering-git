git diff                       # shows changes in the working tree that are not staged
git diff --cached              # shows changes staged for the next commit (index vs HEAD)
git diff --staged              # same as --cached
git diff HEAD                  # shows differences between working tree and the last commit
git diff <file>                # shows changes in a specific file (working tree vs index)
